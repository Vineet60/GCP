# GCP

Using the power of Docker and GCP, I successfully containerized and deployed a simple Flask website. The process involved:

1️⃣ Coding the Application
2️⃣ Creating a Dockerfile for defining the container image
3️⃣ Building the Container with Docker
4️⃣ Pushing the Image to Container Registry
5️⃣ Deploying and Running on GCP
